 # Maze Solver

A C++ program that generates a Maze that can be solved by a player using w a s d keys, and after completion, the maze outputs out time.
After completion, a shortest path or solution is shown using Dijkstra's and BFS algorithm

## Introduction

Maze Solver is a C++ project that generates random mazes of different difficulties and provides the functionality to find and visualize the shortest path from the start to the end of the maze. It utilizes a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path. The project offers an interactive command-line interface for users to navigate through the maze.

## Features

- Generates random mazes of varying difficulties.
- Finds the shortest path through the generated maze.
- Interactive maze navigation using 'w' (up), 's' (down), 'a' (left), or 'd' (right) inputs.
- Visualization of the maze with different colors for walls, the path, start, and end points.

## Getting Started
